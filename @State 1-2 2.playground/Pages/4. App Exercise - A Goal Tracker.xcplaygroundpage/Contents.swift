/*:
 Make all four changes below inside `GoalTrackerView` in the code above.

 1. Add a `@State` property called `stepGoal` and give it a starting value of `5000`.
 2. Inside the `VStack`, under `Text("Step goal")`, add a `Text` view that shows the value of `stepGoal`.
 3. Under that `Text` view, add an `HStack` holding three buttons. One labeled `-1000` subtracts 1000 from `stepGoal`. One labeled `Reset` sets `stepGoal` back to 5000. One labeled `+1000` adds 1000 to `stepGoal`.
 4. Add a `Spacer()` between the `Text` view showing `stepGoal` and the `HStack`, so the buttons sit at the bottom of the view.

 Run the page and tap all three buttons.

 You have one `stepGoal` property and three buttons that change it. Explain in a comment below why the `Text` view shows the right number no matter which button you tap.

PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(GoalTrackerView())

// The Text view shows the right number because all three buttons modify the same @State property, stepGoal, causing SwiftUI to refresh the view.
